## Architecture Overview

### 1. LLM Integration
- **Library Used**: Utilize a library like `rml_rtmp` for handling real-time streaming of LLM responses. While primarily designed for RTMP, it can be adapted for streaming text responses from an LLM.

### 2. Router Implementation
- **Routerify**: Employ **Routerify**, a robust routing system for HTTP requests in Rust, extended to handle streaming data. Routerify supports middleware, which can be leveraged for real-time data ingestion and processing.

    ```rust
    use routerify::{Router, Middleware, Request, Response, Body};
    use hyper::{StatusCode, body::HttpBody};
    use std::convert::Infallible;

    async fn stream_llm_response(req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> {
        // Simulate streaming LLM response
        let (mut sender, body) = Body::channel();
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            for chunk in ["I've scheduled a meeting with John for next Wednesday at 10 AM.", "The weather forecast for that day is sunny with a high of 75¬∞F."].iter() {
                if sender.send_data(chunk.as_bytes().to_vec()).await.is_err() {
                    break;
                }
                tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
            }
        });
        Ok(Response::new(body))
    }

    let router = Router::builder()
        .get("/chat", stream_llm_response)
        .build()
        .unwrap();
    ```

### 3. Real-Time Data Ingestion
- **Tinybird**: Although not directly a router, Tinybird can be utilized for real-time data ingestion and processing, handling high volumes of event streams, which is beneficial for managing data flow from the LLM and external tools.

### 4. Inflight Aggregation and Tool Integration
- **Middleware Implementation**: Develop middleware in Routerify to analyze streaming data from the LLM. This middleware can detect intents and initiate API calls to external services like calendar or weather APIs.

    ```rust
    async fn analyze_and_integrate(req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> {
        let (mut sender, body) = Body::channel();
        let mut response = req.into_body();
        while let Some(chunk) = response.data().await {
            let chunk = chunk.unwrap();
            let text = String::from_utf8_lossy(&chunk);
            // Analyze text for intents
            if text.contains("schedule a meeting") {
                // Call calendar API
            }
            if text.contains("check weather") {
                // Call weather API
            }
            sender.send_data(chunk).await.unwrap();
        }
        Ok(Response::new(body))
    }

    let router = Router::builder()
        .middleware(Middleware::pre(analyze_and_integrate))
        .build()
        .unwrap();
    ```

### 5. Intelligent Caching
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Implement caching within the middleware or as a separate service to store frequent queries or responses. This can be achieved using in-memory caching or integrating with external solutions like Redis.

### 6. ADBC Integration
- **Backend Service Interaction**: For fetching data from various backend services, implement custom logic or use libraries like `tokio-postgres` for database queries, or directly call APIs using `reqwest` or similar HTTP clients.

mod router;
mod handlers;
mod midstream;

use dotenv::dotenv;
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use hyper::Server;
use routerify::RouterService;
use real_time_agent::router::create_router;
use real_time_agent::midstream::Midstream;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    dotenv().ok(); // Load variables from .env

    // Initialize MidStream
    let midstream = Midstream::new().await.expect("Failed to initialize MidStream");

    // Create the main router with MidStream instance
    let router = create_router(midstream);

    // Wrap the router in a Hyper service
    let service = RouterService::new(router).expect("Failed to create RouterService");

    // Define socket address
    let port: u16 = std::env::var("SERVER_PORT")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "8080".to_string())
        .parse()
        .expect("PORT must be a number");
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([0, 0, 0, 0], port));

    // Start the HTTP server
    println!("Server listening on http://{}", addr);

    if let Err(err) = Server::bind(&addr).serve(service).await {
        eprintln!("Server error: {}", err);
    }
}
```

---

### 2. `src/router.rs`

Defines the application's routes and middleware using **Routerify**. Integrates **MidStream** for real-time data ingestion and analysis.

```rust
// src/router.rs

use routerify::{Router, Middleware, Request, Response, Body};
use hyper::StatusCode;
use std::convert::Infallible;
use crate::handlers::{stream_llm_response, fallback_handler};
use crate::midstream::Midstream;

pub fn create_router(midstream: Midstream) -> Router<Body, Infallible> {
    Router::builder()
        // Pre-middleware: analyze inflight data using MidStream
        .middleware(Middleware::pre(move |req| {
            let midstream = midstream.clone();
            async move { 
                real_time_agent::midstream::analyze_and_integrate_middleware(req, midstream).await 
            }
        }))
        // Routes
        .get("/chat", stream_llm_response)
        // Fallback for not-found or other
        .any(fallback_handler)
        .build()
        .unwrap()
}
```

---

### 3. `src/handlers.rs`

Contains handler functions for individual routes, including the simulated LLM streaming response.

```rust
// src/handlers.rs

use hyper::{Body, Response, StatusCode};
use std::convert::Infallible;
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

/// Simulate streaming LLM response
pub async fn stream_llm_response(_req: hyper::Request<Body>) 
    -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> 
{
    // Create a channel to stream data
    let (mut sender, body) = Body::channel();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        let simulated_chunks = vec![
            "I've scheduled a meeting with John for next Wednesday at 10 AM. ",
            "The weather forecast for that day is sunny with a high of 75¬∞F."
        ];

        for chunk in simulated_chunks {
            if sender.send_data(chunk.as_bytes().to_vec()).await.is_err() {
                break;
            }
            // Simulate delay between partial outputs
            sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
        }
    });

    Ok(Response::new(body))
}

/// Fallback handler for unmatched routes
pub async fn fallback_handler(_: hyper::Request<Body>) 
    -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> 
{
    let mut resp = Response::new(Body::from("Not Found"));
    *resp.status_mut() = StatusCode::NOT_FOUND;
    Ok(resp)
}
```

> **Note:** In a real-world scenario, you would replace the `simulated_chunks` with actual streaming responses from an LLM API.

---

### 4. `src/midstream.rs`

Implements **MidStream** integration for real-time data ingestion and inflight analysis. This module initializes MidStream and provides middleware for analyzing streaming data to detect intents and trigger tool integrations.

```rust
// src/midstream.rs

use midstream::MidstreamClient; // Hypothetical MidStream client
use hyper::{Body, Request};
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::Mutex;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Midstream {
    client: Arc<Mutex<MidstreamClient>>,
}

impl Midstream {
    pub async fn new() -> Result<Self, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        // Initialize MidStream client with configurations from .env
        let backend_url = std::env::var("MIDSTREAM_BACKEND_URL")
            .expect("MIDSTREAM_BACKEND_URL must be set");
        let username = std::env::var("MIDSTREAM_ENGINE_USERNAME")
            .expect("MIDSTREAM_ENGINE_USERNAME must be set");
        let password = std::env::var("MIDSTREAM_ENGINE_PASSWORD")
            .expect("MIDSTREAM_ENGINE_PASSWORD must be set");
        let driver_path = std::env::var("MIDSTREAM_DRIVER_PATH")
            .expect("MIDSTREAM_DRIVER_PATH must be set");

        let client = MidstreamClient::new(&backend_url, &username, &password, &driver_path).await?;

        Ok(Self {
            client: Arc::new(Mutex::new(client)),
        })
    }
}

/// Middleware for analyzing and integrating inflight data
pub async fn analyze_and_integrate_middleware(
    req: Request<Body>,
    midstream: Midstream,
) -> Result<Request<Body>, std::convert::Infallible> {
    // For demonstration, assume that the request body contains streamed LLM responses
    // In a real implementation, integrate with MidStream's data processing pipeline

    // Clone necessary data
    let body = req.body().clone();
    
    // Process the body in a background task
    let midstream_clone = midstream.clone();
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        // Example: Extract text from the body and analyze
        if let Ok(full_body) = hyper::body::to_bytes(body).await {
            let text = String::from_utf8_lossy(&full_body);
            if text.contains("schedule a meeting") {
                // Trigger calendar API call
                println!("[MIDSTREAM] Detected intent: schedule a meeting");
                // Implement actual API call here
                // e.g., schedule_meeting().await;
            }
            if text.contains("check weather") {
                // Trigger weather API call
                println!("[MIDSTREAM] Detected intent: check weather");
                // Implement actual API call here
                // e.g., check_weather().await;
            }

            // Optionally, store or process data with MidStream
            // Example: midstream_clone.client.lock().await.store_metric(...).await;
        }
    });

    // Pass the request through unchanged
    Ok(req)
}
```

> **Notes:**
> - The `MidstreamClient` and its methods are **hypothetical**. Replace them with actual implementations based on MidStream's API.
> - This middleware asynchronously processes the request body to detect intents and trigger corresponding actions.
> - In a real-world scenario, handle streaming data more gracefully, possibly integrating with MidStream's real-time data processing features.
